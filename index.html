				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					I’m a multi-skilled creative and technical builder — combining
					Frontend Development, Smart Contract Engineering, and Social Media
					Management to deliver real impact across digital spaces. On the dev
					side, I specialize in building smooth, responsive interfaces using
					React.js, JavaScript, HTML5, and Node.js. I love creating frontend
					experiences that are not just functional, but intuitive and clean. I
					also dive deep into Web3 as a Solidity Developer — writing, testing,
					and deploying smart contracts using tools like Hardhat and Ethers.js.
					Whether it’s token creation, NFTs, or DeFi applications, I build with
					security, scalability, and real-world use in mind. Outside of code,
					I’ve managed and grown online communities as a Social Media Manager
					for brands like Autosense and Bejite, crafting strategies that
					connect, convert, and communicate value across platforms. Always
					learning. Always building. Always staying ahead.
